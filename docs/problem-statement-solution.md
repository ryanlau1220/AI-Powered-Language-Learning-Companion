# Problem Statement and Solution Analysis

## AI-Powered Language Learning Companion

### Problem Statement

In the market, there are existing popular language learning apps that are the go-to way for language enthusiasts or foreign workers to pick up new language. However, the learning process often lacks personalisation to the needs and learning style of individual learners, and may have limited contextual practice with insufficient real-world conversational scenarios. Develop a generative AI solution that creates customized language exercises, dialogues, or quizzes based on a learner's proficiency level, native language, and interests. The system should generate realistic conversational scenarios or cultural context to enhance immersion and retention.
